Internship Projects Using AI:

The two projects showcased in this repository were done during my AI internship. They demonstrate the application of machine learning and deep learning with Python.  

1. Recognition of Handwritten Digits:  

A CNN trained on the MNIST dataset to recognize digits (0â€“9), showcasing deep learning's power in image classification.

It features:

- A portion of MNIST is used for the training subset to improve speed  

- Basic training yields over 95% accuracy  

2. Stock Price Predictor:

Stock closing prices prediction from historical values using regression is done through linear regression modeling.  

It features:

- Retrieves the historical data of stocks through `yfinance`  

- Uses linear regression for price predictions on future dates.  

- Uses `matplotlib` for trend plotting  

Requirements:

Before running the projects, the following libraries of Python need to be installed:  

for 1st project: 'pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn yfinance' 
for 2nd: 'pip install tensorflow matplotlib'
